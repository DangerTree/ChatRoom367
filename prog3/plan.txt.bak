Computer Networks I

1) We are asked to create a chat room similar to an AIM chat, albeit less pretty and running on a terminal. To do so, we will create three files: 1) A server to service connection requests and transmit data between clients, 2) a participant client that sends messages to the server and recieves messages from other participants, 3) an observer client which may latch onto a participant and recieve all chat room messages in addition to private messages to the participant they are stalking.

2) At this time, I do not see any faults in the protocol.

3) The most challenging part of this assignment will not going down a rabbit hole on a problem. I need to make a plan, stick to it, and make changes to it when necessary. When I need to alter my plan, it is important that I put thought into if it will the be best choice and not cause me unnessisary work or pain, like in program 2.

4) GDB (my bffl), man pages about fuctions (like select), the internet.

5) Perhaps fragglet.
